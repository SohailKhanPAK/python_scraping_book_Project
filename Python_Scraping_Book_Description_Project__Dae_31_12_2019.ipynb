Through a careful examination of the most recent archaeological discoveries from excavations in both Pakistan and India, the author provides a stimulating discussion on the nature of the early cities and their inhabitants. This detailed study of the Indus architecture and civic organization also takes into account the distinctive crafts and technological developments that accompanied the emergence of urbanism. Indus trade and economy as well as political and religious organizations are illuminated through comparisons with other contemporaneous civilizations in Mesopotamia and Central Asia and through ethnoarchaeological studies in later cultures of South Asia.\\r\\nThe book is written as an introductory text on the Indus civilization, along with a catalogue section that illustrates some of the important objects recovered during the most recent excavations at Harappa, as well as earlier finds from excavations in the 1920s and 1930s.

These were constructed during the Muslim rule in the areas now forming Pakistan. The book is illustrated with photographs and plans of some selected examples of such structures. Muslim rulers evinced great interest in raising splendid structures, many of which—particularly those reflecting the public welfare aspects of Muslim architecture— are yet to be properly explored and studied. Khurshid Hasan Shaikh has undertaken the task of documenting and studying such public welfare structures in Pakistan, as owing to the passage of time, vagaries of nature, and continued neglect, all such buildings have suffered.

These buildings are also stylistically distinct from architecture in adjoining regions. This book traces the emergence of this extraordinary building tradition with reference to lesser known commemorative sites throughout the Indus Valley that predate more famous monuments. On the basis of extensive fieldwork, Edwards provides detailed descriptions of individual structures tracking brickworking styles and other significant craft practices. The catalogue of monuments is contextualized with a brief historical narrative and art historical commentary. What distinguishes this study is its tight focus on material evidence and local ethos presented against the grain of previous scholarship. Thus, whereas traditional analysis explains Pakistan’s tiled and turreted tombs from the top down, citing dynastic patronage and stylistic influences from elsewhere, this book argues from the ground up emphasizing politically atomized environments, vernacular building methods, pertinent oral traditions, and indigenous modes of spirituality.

It is an important work, since in recent times class analyses have been largely neglected in works on South Asia, particularly on Pakistan. This study therefore fills a gap in our knowledge. Sketching the history of the region that is now Pakistan, it analyzes the class structure from the time of the Mughal Empire, through the distortions of the colonial era and the transition to capitalism, to the class structure of contemporary Pakistan. It avoids over-schematic arguments, attempting to proceed from facts rather than from any ideal forms. The study develops three propositions.\\nFirst, the author establishes that the mode of production of pre-colonial South Asia was qualitatively distinct from European feudalism. Marx’s notion of the Asiatic mode of production is more consistent with the pre-colonial historical evidence.\\nSecond, the colonial path of capitalist development of South Asia resulted in a socio-economic formation that combined features of the Asiatic and capitalist modes of production, which this study terms Asiatic capitalism. Empirical analysis of agrarian relations in Pakistan reveals the relative absence of wage labour and the continuing existence of various forms of pre-capitalist economic relations within the overall framework of a capitalist economy.\\nThird, the vast majority of the non-agricultural working population of Pakistan today is engaged in handicraft and manufacture. However, manufacturing and services are dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. Hence, while being significant in terms of output, the formal large-scale industrial sector, which was developed along the model of state-corporate capitalism, remains relatively small in terms of provision of employment.\\nThe author concludes that the class structure of Pakistan is characterized by Asiatic capitalism, with the non-agricultural sector of the economy dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. This has implications for the country’s politics, society, and culture.', 'Author Discription': 'Dr. Taimur Rahman teaches Political Science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS).

Akbar Zaidi', 'Book Description': \"This book is about understanding Pakistan’s structural transformation over six decades in a political economy framework. The author examines how and where such transformations have taken place in the economy, society, in class and gender relations, in manifestations of consumerism and culture, and in other ways. He assesses Pakistan's trajectory of economic and political development and focuses on an economic and social history of Pakistan, using a political economy framework to examine the nature of this structural transformation. The book follows the narrative of the evolution of Pakistan's social, economic and even political dispensation over many decades, highlighting key developments and events. As has happened so many times in Pakistan’s history, events with unintended consequences have shaped developments. Yet, social and economic change has also been somewhat anticipated and predictable, giving rise to relatively more certain outcomes. The immense growth of urban populations, of a middle class, and of a buoyant informal sector, alongside the breakdown of state authority and state institutions, has been unfolding almost expectantly. The previous trend of the 'urbanization of everybody', seems to have morphed into an 'urbanization with informalization', with the co-movements of urbanization and informal relations of production and exchange perhaps dominating social and political interaction. What this means for subsequent developments remains uncertain.\\nIssues in Pakistan’s Economy: A Political Economy Perspective will interest serious scholars of Pakistan's economic history and its developments, as well as those who seek to understand how social and economic processes have an impact on numerous outcomes and forms of structural transformation, and how, in a political economy perspective, state and society evolve.\", 'Author Discription': 'S Akbar Zaidi is a prolific political economist.

It is something that develops in a community. The culture, political thought, and sociological dimension of people living in a group have a direct bearing on the language they speak. That is why language is never regarded as something neutral, and the medium of instruction used in school has far-reaching implications. It can facilitate the social, cultural, and intellectual development or it can hurt the capacity to learn. Unfortunately, factors other than these obvious ones have determined the language to be used to teach a young child in Pakistan. The failure to look at language as a crucial component of education per se has resulted in our failure to spread literacy and learning in the country.\\nCan we reform education in Pakistan using any language? No, says the author, who argues her case from a young child’s perspective. Since the first edition of this book, a lot of research has been carried out on this subject. The findings have not changed, but they shed new light on the subject and should certainly create more awareness among educationists and policymakers, as well as parents.

These buildings are also stylistically distinct from architecture in adjoining regions. This book traces the emergence of this extraordinary building tradition with reference to lesser known commemorative sites throughout the Indus Valley that predate more famous monuments.

What distinguishes this study is its tight focus on material evidence and local ethos presented against the grain of previous scholarship.

It is an important work, since in recent times class analyses have been largely neglected in works on South Asia, particularly on Pakistan. This study therefore fills a gap in our knowledge. Sketching the history of the region that is now Pakistan, it analyzes the class structure from the time of the Mughal Empire, through the distortions of the colonial era and the transition to capitalism, to the class structure of contemporary Pakistan. It avoids over-schematic arguments, attempting to proceed from facts rather than from any ideal forms. The study develops three propositions.\\nFirst, the author establishes that the mode of production of pre-colonial South Asia was qualitatively distinct from European feudalism. Marx’s notion of the Asiatic mode of production is more consistent with the pre-colonial historical evidence.\\nSecond, the colonial path of capitalist development of South Asia resulted in a socio-economic formation that combined features of the Asiatic and capitalist modes of production, which this study terms Asiatic capitalism. Empirical analysis of agrarian relations in Pakistan reveals the relative absence of wage labour and the continuing existence of various forms of pre-capitalist economic relations within the overall framework of a capitalist economy.\\nThird, the vast majority of the non-agricultural working population of Pakistan today is engaged in handicraft and manufacture. However, manufacturing and services are dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. Hence, while being significant in terms of output, the formal large-scale industrial sector, which was developed along the model of state-corporate capitalism, remains relatively small in terms of provision of employment.\\nThe author concludes that the class structure of Pakistan is characterized by Asiatic capitalism, with the non-agricultural sector of the economy dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism.

The author examines how and where such transformations have taken place in the economy, society, in class and gender relations, in manifestations of consumerism and culture, and in other ways. He assesses Pakistan's trajectory of economic and political development and focuses on an economic and social history of Pakistan, using a political economy framework to examine the nature of this structural transformation. The book follows the narrative of the evolution of Pakistan's social, economic and even political dispensation over many decades, highlighting key developments and events. As has happened so many times in Pakistan’s history, events with unintended consequences have shaped developments. Yet, social and economic change has also been somewhat anticipated and predictable, giving rise to relatively more certain outcomes. The immense growth of urban populations, of a middle class, and of a buoyant informal sector, alongside the breakdown of state authority and state institutions, has been unfolding almost expectantly. The previous trend of the 'urbanization of everybody', seems to have morphed into an 'urbanization with informalization', with the co-movements of urbanization and informal relations of production and exchange perhaps dominating social and political interaction. What this means for subsequent developments remains uncertain.\\nIssues in Pakistan’s Economy: A Political Economy Perspective will interest serious scholars of Pakistan's economic history and its developments, as well as those who seek to understand how social and economic processes have an impact on numerous outcomes and forms of structural transformation, and how, in a political economy perspective, state and society evolve.\", 'Author Discription': 'S Akbar Zaidi is a prolific political economist.

It is something that develops in a community. The culture, political thought, and sociological dimension of people living in a group have a direct bearing on the language they speak. That is why language is never regarded as something neutral, and the medium of instruction used in school has far-reaching implications. It can facilitate the social, cultural, and intellectual development or it can hurt the capacity to learn. Unfortunately, factors other than these obvious ones have determined the language to be used to teach a young child in Pakistan. The failure to look at language as a crucial component of education per se has resulted in our failure to spread literacy and learning in the country.\\nCan we reform education in Pakistan using any language? No, says the author, who argues her case from a young child’s perspective. Since the first edition of this book, a lot of research has been carried out on this subject. The findings have not changed, but they shed new light on the subject and should certainly create more awareness among educationists and policymakers, as well as parents.

These buildings are also stylistically distinct from architecture in adjoining regions. This book traces the emergence of this extraordinary building tradition with reference to lesser known commemorative sites throughout the Indus Valley that predate more famous monuments. On the basis of extensive fieldwork, Edwards provides detailed descriptions of individual structures tracking brickworking styles and other significant craft practices. The catalogue of monuments is contextualized with a brief historical narrative and art historical commentary. What distinguishes this study is its tight focus on material evidence and local ethos presented against the grain of previous scholarship. Thus, whereas traditional analysis explains Pakistan’s tiled and turreted tombs from the top down, citing dynastic patronage and stylistic influences from elsewhere, this book argues from the ground up emphasizing politically atomized environments, vernacular building methods, pertinent oral traditions, and indigenous modes of spirituality.

It is an important work, since in recent times class analyses have been largely neglected in works on South Asia, particularly on Pakistan. This study therefore fills a gap in our knowledge. Sketching the history of the region that is now Pakistan, it analyzes the class structure from the time of the Mughal Empire, through the distortions of the colonial era and the transition to capitalism, to the class structure of contemporary Pakistan. It avoids over-schematic arguments, attempting to proceed from facts rather than from any ideal forms. The study develops three propositions.\\nFirst, the author establishes that the mode of production of pre-colonial South Asia was qualitatively distinct from European feudalism. Marx’s notion of the Asiatic mode of production is more consistent with the pre-colonial historical evidence.\\nSecond, the colonial path of capitalist development of South Asia resulted in a socio-economic formation that combined features of the Asiatic and capitalist modes of production, which this study terms Asiatic capitalism. Empirical analysis of agrarian relations in Pakistan reveals the relative absence of wage labour and the continuing existence of various forms of pre-capitalist economic relations within the overall framework of a capitalist economy.\\nThird, the vast majority of the non-agricultural working population of Pakistan today is engaged in handicraft and manufacture. However, manufacturing and services are dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. Hence, while being significant in terms of output, the formal large-scale industrial sector, which was developed along the model of state-corporate capitalism, remains relatively small in terms of provision of employment.\\nThe author concludes that the class structure of Pakistan is characterized by Asiatic capitalism, with the non-agricultural sector of the economy dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. This has implications for the country’s politics, society, and culture.', 'Author Discription': 'Dr. Taimur Rahman teaches Political Science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS).

Akbar Zaidi', 'Book Description': \"This book is about understanding Pakistan’s structural transformation over six decades in a political economy framework. The author examines how and where such transformations have taken place in the economy, society, in class and gender relations, in manifestations of consumerism and culture, and in other ways. He assesses Pakistan's trajectory of economic and political development and focuses on an economic and social history of Pakistan, using a political economy framework to examine the nature of this structural transformation. The book follows the narrative of the evolution of Pakistan's social, economic and even political dispensation over many decades, highlighting key developments and events. As has happened so many times in Pakistan’s history, events with unintended consequences have shaped developments. Yet, social and economic change has also been somewhat anticipated and predictable, giving rise to relatively more certain outcomes. The immense growth of urban populations, of a middle class, and of a buoyant informal sector, alongside the breakdown of state authority and state institutions, has been unfolding almost expectantly. The previous trend of the 'urbanization of everybody', seems to have morphed into an 'urbanization with informalization', with the co-movements of urbanization and informal relations of production and exchange perhaps dominating social and political interaction. What this means for subsequent developments remains uncertain.\\nIssues in Pakistan’s Economy: A Political Economy Perspective will interest serious scholars of Pakistan's economic history and its developments, as well as those who seek to understand how social and economic processes have an impact on numerous outcomes and forms of structural transformation, and how, in a political economy perspective, state and society evolve.\", 'Author Discription': 'S Akbar Zaidi is a prolific political economist.

It is something that develops in a community. The culture, political thought, and sociological dimension of people living in a group have a direct bearing on the language they speak. That is why language is never regarded as something neutral, and the medium of instruction used in school has far-reaching implications. It can facilitate the social, cultural, and intellectual development or it can hurt the capacity to learn. Unfortunately, factors other than these obvious ones have determined the language to be used to teach a young child in Pakistan. The failure to look at language as a crucial component of education per se has resulted in our failure to spread literacy and learning in the country.\\nCan we reform education in Pakistan using any language? No, says the author, who argues her case from a young child’s perspective. Since the first edition of this book, a lot of research has been carried out on this subject.

In addition to this, the book also provides teachers’ insights on how to develop themselves into mentors or teacher educators and thus enhance their impact in schools by not only teaching students, but also other teachers. Halai aims at aiding teachers away from conventional and towards new tutoring techniques by providing a broad context of study.', 'Author Discription': 'Nelofer Halai is Professor at Aga Khan University Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED), Karachi.

The historical monuments studied in this book include baolies (step-wells), caravanserais, baradaries, kos minars, bridges, and hammams, which were meant for the welfare and comfort of the public. These were constructed during the Muslim rule in the areas now forming Pakistan. The book is illustrated with photographs and plans of some selected examples of such structures. Muslim rulers evinced great interest in raising splendid structures, many of which—particularly those reflecting the public welfare aspects of Muslim architecture— are yet to be properly explored and studied. Khurshid Hasan Shaikh has undertaken the task of documenting and studying such public welfare structures in Pakistan, as owing to the passage of time, vagaries of nature, and continued neglect, all such buildings have suffered.

These buildings are also stylistically distinct from architecture in adjoining regions. This book traces the emergence of this extraordinary building tradition with reference to lesser known commemorative sites throughout the Indus Valley that predate more famous monuments. On the basis of extensive fieldwork, Edwards provides detailed descriptions of individual structures tracking brickworking styles and other significant craft practices. The catalogue of monuments is contextualized with a brief historical narrative and art historical commentary. What distinguishes this study is its tight focus on material evidence and local ethos presented against the grain of previous scholarship. Thus, whereas traditional analysis explains Pakistan’s tiled and turreted tombs from the top down, citing dynastic patronage and stylistic influences from elsewhere, this book argues from the ground up emphasizing politically atomized environments, vernacular building methods, pertinent oral traditions, and indigenous modes of spirituality. By this means, the unique character of this architectural tradition is underscored.

It is an important work, since in recent times class analyses have been largely neglected in works on South Asia, particularly on Pakistan. This study therefore fills a gap in our knowledge. Sketching the history of the region that is now Pakistan, it analyzes the class structure from the time of the Mughal Empire, through the distortions of the colonial era and the transition to capitalism, to the class structure of contemporary Pakistan. It avoids over-schematic arguments, attempting to proceed from facts rather than from any ideal forms. The study develops three propositions.\\nFirst, the author establishes that the mode of production of pre-colonial South Asia was qualitatively distinct from European feudalism. Marx’s notion of the Asiatic mode of production is more consistent with the pre-colonial historical evidence.\\nSecond, the colonial path of capitalist development of South Asia resulted in a socio-economic formation that combined features of the Asiatic and capitalist modes of production, which this study terms Asiatic capitalism. Empirical analysis of agrarian relations in Pakistan reveals the relative absence of wage labour and the continuing existence of various forms of pre-capitalist economic relations within the overall framework of a capitalist economy.\\nThird, the vast majority of the non-agricultural working population of Pakistan today is engaged in handicraft and manufacture. However, manufacturing and services are dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. Hence, while being significant in terms of output, the formal large-scale industrial sector, which was developed along the model of state-corporate capitalism, remains relatively small in terms of provision of employment.\\nThe author concludes that the class structure of Pakistan is characterized by Asiatic capitalism, with the non-agricultural sector of the economy dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. This has implications for the country’s politics, society, and culture.', 'Author Discription': 'Dr. Taimur Rahman teaches Political Science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS).

Akbar Zaidi', 'Book Description': \"This book is about understanding Pakistan’s structural transformation over six decades in a political economy framework. The author examines how and where such transformations have taken place in the economy, society, in class and gender relations, in manifestations of consumerism and culture, and in other ways. He assesses Pakistan's trajectory of economic and political development and focuses on an economic and social history of Pakistan, using a political economy framework to examine the nature of this structural transformation. The book follows the narrative of the evolution of Pakistan's social, economic and even political dispensation over many decades, highlighting key developments and events. As has happened so many times in Pakistan’s history, events with unintended consequences have shaped developments. Yet, social and economic change has also been somewhat anticipated and predictable, giving rise to relatively more certain outcomes. The immense growth of urban populations, of a middle class, and of a buoyant informal sector, alongside the breakdown of state authority and state institutions, has been unfolding almost expectantly. The previous trend of the 'urbanization of everybody', seems to have morphed into an 'urbanization with informalization', with the co-movements of urbanization and informal relations of production and exchange perhaps dominating social and political interaction. What this means for subsequent developments remains uncertain.\\nIssues in Pakistan’s Economy: A Political Economy Perspective will interest serious scholars of Pakistan's economic history and its developments, as well as those who seek to understand how social and economic processes have an impact on numerous outcomes and forms of structural transformation, and how, in a political economy perspective, state and society evolve.\", 'Author Discription': 'S Akbar Zaidi is a prolific political economist.

These were constructed during the Muslim rule in the areas now forming Pakistan. The book is illustrated with photographs and plans of some selected examples of such structures. Muslim rulers evinced great interest in raising splendid structures, many of which—particularly those reflecting the public welfare aspects of Muslim architecture— are yet to be properly explored and studied. Khurshid Hasan Shaikh has undertaken the task of documenting and studying such public welfare structures in Pakistan, as owing to the passage of time, vagaries of nature, and continued neglect, all such buildings have suffered.

These buildings are also stylistically distinct from architecture in adjoining regions. This book traces the emergence of this extraordinary building tradition with reference to lesser known commemorative sites throughout the Indus Valley that predate more famous monuments. On the basis of extensive fieldwork, Edwards provides detailed descriptions of individual structures tracking brickworking styles and other significant craft practices. The catalogue of monuments is contextualized with a brief historical narrative and art historical commentary. What distinguishes this study is its tight focus on material evidence and local ethos presented against the grain of previous scholarship. Thus, whereas traditional analysis explains Pakistan’s tiled and turreted tombs from the top down, citing dynastic patronage and stylistic influences from elsewhere, this book argues from the ground up emphasizing politically atomized environments, vernacular building methods, pertinent oral traditions, and indigenous modes of spirituality.

            "{'Book Name': ['The Class Structure of Pakistan'], 'Aurthor Name': 'Taimur Rahman', 'Book Description': 'This work on the class structure of Pakistan is based on the framework of historical materialism. It is an important work, since in recent times class analyses have been largely neglected in works on South Asia, particularly on Pakistan. This study therefore fills a gap in our knowledge. Sketching the history of the region that is now Pakistan, it analyzes the class structure from the time of the Mughal Empire, through the distortions of the colonial era and the transition to capitalism, to the class structure of contemporary Pakistan. It avoids over-schematic arguments, attempting to proceed from facts rather than from any ideal forms. The study develops three propositions.\\nFirst, the author establishes that the mode of production of pre-colonial South Asia was qualitatively distinct from European feudalism. Marx’s notion of the Asiatic mode of production is more consistent with the pre-colonial historical evidence.\\nSecond, the colonial path of capitalist development of South Asia resulted in a socio-economic formation that combined features of the Asiatic and capitalist modes of production, which this study terms Asiatic capitalism. Empirical analysis of agrarian relations in Pakistan reveals the relative absence of wage labour and the continuing existence of various forms of pre-capitalist economic relations within the overall framework of a capitalist economy.\\nThird, the vast majority of the non-agricultural working population of Pakistan today is engaged in handicraft and manufacture. However, manufacturing and services are dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. Hence, while being significant in terms of output, the formal large-scale industrial sector, which was developed along the model of state-corporate capitalism, remains relatively small in terms of provision of employment.\\nThe author concludes that the class structure of Pakistan is characterized by Asiatic capitalism, with the non-agricultural sector of the economy dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. This has implications for the country’s politics, society, and culture.', 'Author Discription': 'Dr. Taimur Rahman teaches Political Science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS).

Akbar Zaidi', 'Book Description': \"This book is about understanding Pakistan’s structural transformation over six decades in a political economy framework. The author examines how and where such transformations have taken place in the economy, society, in class and gender relations, in manifestations of consumerism and culture, and in other ways. He assesses Pakistan's trajectory of economic and political development and focuses on an economic and social history of Pakistan, using a political economy framework to examine the nature of this structural transformation. The book follows the narrative of the evolution of Pakistan's social, economic and even political dispensation over many decades, highlighting key developments and events. As has happened so many times in Pakistan’s history, events with unintended consequences have shaped developments. Yet, social and economic change has also been somewhat anticipated and predictable, giving rise to relatively more certain outcomes. The immense growth of urban populations, of a middle class, and of a buoyant informal sector, alongside the breakdown of state authority and state institutions, has been unfolding almost expectantly. The previous trend of the 'urbanization of everybody', seems to have morphed into an 'urbanization with informalization', with the co-movements of urbanization and informal relations of production and exchange perhaps dominating social and political interaction. What this means for subsequent developments remains uncertain.\\nIssues in Pakistan’s Economy: A Political Economy Perspective will interest serious scholars of Pakistan's economic history and its developments, as well as those who seek to understand how social and economic processes have an impact on numerous outcomes and forms of structural transformation, and how, in a political economy perspective, state and society evolve.\", 'Author Discription': 'S Akbar Zaidi is a prolific political economist.

These were constructed during the Muslim rule in the areas now forming Pakistan. The book is illustrated with photographs and plans of some selected examples of such structures. Muslim rulers evinced great interest in raising splendid structures, many of which—particularly those reflecting the public welfare aspects of Muslim architecture— are yet to be properly explored and studied. Khurshid Hasan Shaikh has undertaken the task of documenting and studying such public welfare structures in Pakistan, as owing to the passage of time, vagaries of nature, and continued neglect, all such buildings have suffered.

These buildings are also stylistically distinct from architecture in adjoining regions. This book traces the emergence of this extraordinary building tradition with reference to lesser known commemorative sites throughout the Indus Valley that predate more famous monuments. On the basis of extensive fieldwork, Edwards provides detailed descriptions of individual structures tracking brickworking styles and other significant craft practices. The catalogue of monuments is contextualized with a brief historical narrative and art historical commentary. What distinguishes this study is its tight focus on material evidence and local ethos presented against the grain of previous scholarship. Thus, whereas traditional analysis explains Pakistan’s tiled and turreted tombs from the top down, citing dynastic patronage and stylistic influences from elsewhere, this book argues from the ground up emphasizing politically atomized environments, vernacular building methods, pertinent oral traditions, and indigenous modes of spirituality.

It is an important work, since in recent times class analyses have been largely neglected in works on South Asia, particularly on Pakistan. This study therefore fills a gap in our knowledge. Sketching the history of the region that is now Pakistan, it analyzes the class structure from the time of the Mughal Empire, through the distortions of the colonial era and the transition to capitalism, to the class structure of contemporary Pakistan. It avoids over-schematic arguments, attempting to proceed from facts rather than from any ideal forms. The study develops three propositions.\\nFirst, the author establishes that the mode of production of pre-colonial South Asia was qualitatively distinct from European feudalism. Marx’s notion of the Asiatic mode of production is more consistent with the pre-colonial historical evidence.\\nSecond, the colonial path of capitalist development of South Asia resulted in a socio-economic formation that combined features of the Asiatic and capitalist modes of production, which this study terms Asiatic capitalism. Empirical analysis of agrarian relations in Pakistan reveals the relative absence of wage labour and the continuing existence of various forms of pre-capitalist economic relations within the overall framework of a capitalist economy.\\nThird, the vast majority of the non-agricultural working population of Pakistan today is engaged in handicraft and manufacture. However, manufacturing and services are dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. Hence, while being significant in terms of output, the formal large-scale industrial sector, which was developed along the model of state-corporate capitalism, remains relatively small in terms of provision of employment.\\nThe author concludes that the class structure of Pakistan is characterized by Asiatic capitalism, with the non-agricultural sector of the economy dominated by petty commodity production and small-scale capitalism. This has implications for the country’s politics, society, and culture.', 'Author Discription': 'Dr. Taimur Rahman teaches Political Science at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS).

Akbar Zaidi', 'Book Description': \"This book is about understanding Pakistan’s structural transformation over six decades in a political economy framework. The author examines how and where such transformations have taken place in the economy, society, in class and gender relations, in manifestations of consumerism and culture, and in other ways. He assesses Pakistan's trajectory of economic and political development and focuses on an economic and social history of Pakistan, using a political economy framework to examine the nature of this structural transformation. The book follows the narrative of the evolution of Pakistan's social, economic and even political dispensation over many decades, highlighting key developments and events. As has happened so many times in Pakistan’s history, events with unintended consequences have shaped developments. Yet, social and economic change has also been somewhat anticipated and predictable, giving rise to relatively more certain outcomes. The immense growth of urban populations, of a middle class, and of a buoyant informal sector, alongside the breakdown of state authority and state institutions, has been unfolding almost expectantly. The previous trend of the 'urbanization of everybody', seems to have morphed into an 'urbanization with informalization', with the co-movements of urbanization and informal relations of production and exchange perhaps dominating social and political interaction. What this means for subsequent developments remains uncertain.\\nIssues in Pakistan’s Economy: A Political Economy Perspective will interest serious scholars of Pakistan's economic history and its developments, as well as those who seek to understand how social and economic processes have an impact on numerous outcomes and forms of structural transformation, and how, in a political economy perspective, state and society evolve.\", 'Author Discription': 'S Akbar Zaidi is a prolific political economist.

It is something that develops in a community. The culture, political thought, and sociological dimension of people living in a group have a direct bearing on the language they speak.
